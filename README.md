# Express.js-Challenge-Note-Taker

## Description

The note taker app was inspired by a small business owner to write / save / delete notes to organize ideas and thoughts that have to get done. This was built to optimize workflow. It provided a small business to stay organized and productive. What I learned was how to use express and node to create fetch requests from the front end to get data and use that data to create a note taking app.
